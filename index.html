        <h1>Privacy Policy for VConnect</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 9, 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Kshmlg Technologies ("VConnect", "the Application", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information in connection with your use of our Wear OS application. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.</p>

        <p>Our philosophy is one of **minimal data collection**. The Application is designed to act as a secure client between your device and your vehicle manufacturer's official servers, without storing or transmitting your personal data to our own servers.</p>

        <h2>1. Information the Application Handles</h2>
        <p>To function, the Application needs to handle the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Authentication Credentials:</strong> When you log in through the Application, access and refresh tokens are generated by your vehicle's manufacturer. These tokens are necessary to authenticate and authorize the requests the Application makes on your behalf (e.g., to lock the doors or query the battery level).</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Identification Number (VIN):</strong> The Application stores your selected Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to direct commands to the correct car.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Data:</strong> The Application requests and displays real-time data provided by your vehicle manufacturer's API. This includes, but is not limited to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Door and window status.</li>
                    <li>Fuel level and/or battery charge level and range.</li>
                    <li>Vehicle location (latitude and longitude).</li>
                    <li>Engine and climate status.</li>
                    <li>Diagnostic data (e.g., tire pressure, service needs).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Purchase Data (Premium):</strong> If you purchase the Premium version, the Application handles a purchase token provided by Google Play. This token is used solely to verify the validity of your purchase with our secure server.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics and Crash Data:</strong> The Application uses services like Google Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash data. This information does not contain personally identifiable data and is used exclusively to improve the stability and quality of the Application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Your Data is Stored</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is our top priority.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local, Encrypted Storage:</strong> Your authentication credentials (tokens) and your vehicle's VIN are stored **solely within the secure, encrypted storage of your Wear OS device**. We use Android Jetpack's `EncryptedSharedPreferences` library, the industry standard, to protect this information. <strong>These credentials never leave your device to be sent to our servers.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Storage:</strong> We do not operate servers that store your credentials, vehicle data, location, or any other personal information. VConnect acts as a secure intermediary, not a data storage service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Your Data is Used</h2>
        <p>Your information is used strictly and exclusively for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Communicate with Vehicle Servers:</strong> Access tokens are used to authenticate requests to your vehicle manufacturer's official API to execute the commands you request (lock, unlock, etc.) and to fetch the current status of your car.</li>
            <li><strong>To Verify Premium Purchases:</strong> The Google Play purchase token is sent to our server along with a Google Play Integrity token for a one-time verification. We do not store this purchase token.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Application:</strong> Anonymous crash reports help us identify and fix software bugs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, or otherwise share your personal information with third parties. The only data exchange that occurs is that which is strictly necessary for the application's functionality:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With the Vehicle Manufacturer:</strong> All requests related to your car (status, commands, location) are sent directly to the vehicle manufacturer's secure servers, using the authentication tokens you provided upon login. We encourage you to review your vehicle manufacturer's privacy policy to understand how they handle your data.</li>
            <li><strong>With Google Play:</strong> The purchase process is handled entirely by Google Play's billing services.</li>
            <li><strong>With Our License Verifier:</strong> To activate Premium functionality, a one-time purchase token is sent to our server for validation. This process is secure and does not include personal information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Security</h2>
        <p>We have implemented industry-standard security measures, such as the use of `EncryptedSharedPreferences` and communication via HTTPS, to protect the information handled by the Application on your device.</p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>7. Contact Us</h2>
