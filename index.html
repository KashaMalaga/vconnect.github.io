        <h1>Privacy Policy for VConnect</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 9, 2025</p>
        <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Kshmlg Technologies</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Kshmlg Technologies ("VConnect", "the Application", "we", "us", or "our") handles your information. Your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.</p>
        <p>Our philosophy is one of **minimal data collection**. The Application is designed to act as a secure client between your device and your vehicle manufacturer's official servers, without storing or transmitting your personal data to our own servers.</p>

        <h2>1. Information the Application Handles</h2>
        <p>To function, the Application handles the following types of "Personal and Sensitive User Data":</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authentication Information:</strong> When you log in, access and refresh tokens are generated by your vehicle's manufacturer. These are required to authenticate requests the Application makes on your behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Identification Number (VIN):</strong> The Application stores your selected VIN to direct commands to the correct car.</li>
            <li><strong>Vehicle Data:</strong> This includes real-time status information from your vehicle's API, such as door/window status, fuel/battery levels, and diagnostic data.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Location:</strong> The Application requests access to your device's location to display your position on the map relative to your vehicle. The location feature is user-initiated and your location data is not stored or transmitted by us.</li>
            <li><strong>Financial Information (Purchase Tokens):</strong> If you purchase the Premium version, a non-personally identifiable purchase token is handled by the Application to verify the transaction.</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostics and Crash Data:</strong> The Application uses Google Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymous crash data to improve app stability. This does not include personally identifiable information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How Your Data is Stored and Handled Securely</h2>
        <p>The security of your data is our top priority.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local, Encrypted Storage:</strong> Your authentication tokens and VIN are stored **solely within the secure, encrypted storage of your Wear OS device** using Android Jetpack's `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. These credentials never leave your device to be sent to our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Transmission:</strong> All data transmitted by the Application, both to the vehicle manufacturer's servers and to our license verification server, is sent using modern cryptography (HTTPS).</li>
            <li><strong>No Cloud Storage of Personal Data:</strong> We do not operate servers that store your credentials, vehicle data, location, or other personal information. VConnect acts as a secure intermediary, not a data storage service.</li>
            <li><strong>No Sale of Data:</strong> We unequivocally **do not sell** your personal and sensitive user data to any third party for monetary consideration.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How Your Data is Used and Shared</h2>
        <p>Your information is used strictly for purposes that provide app functionality and are reasonably expected by you, the user:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To Communicate with Vehicle Servers:</strong> Access tokens and your VIN are used to authenticate requests to your vehicle manufacturer's official API to execute commands (e.g., lock, unlock) and fetch vehicle status.</li>
            <li><strong>To Verify Premium Purchases:</strong> The Google Play purchase token is sent to our server along with a Google Play Integrity token for a one-time, secure verification.</li>
            <li><strong>To Improve the Application:</strong> Anonymous crash reports help us identify and fix software bugs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The only third parties with whom data is shared are those essential for the app's core function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Vehicle Manufacturer:</strong> All vehicle-related requests are sent directly to their secure servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For handling purchases, integrity checks, and crash reporting.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- NEW: Data Retention and Deletion Section -->
        <h2>4. Data Retention and Deletion Policy</h2>
        <p>The Application adheres to a minimal data retention policy.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data on Device:</strong> All sensitive data (authentication tokens, VIN) is stored locally on your device and is under your control. This data is deleted when you uninstall the Application.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> The Application does not require users to create a separate VConnect account. Your "account" is your link to the vehicle manufacturer's service. To delete your data and sever the connection, you can:
                <ol>
                    <li>Log out from within the Application's settings menu.</li>
                    <li>Uninstall the Application from your device, which deletes all locally stored data.</li>
                    <li>For complete revocation of access, we recommend visiting your vehicle manufacturer's official website or app and revoking third-party application permissions for VConnect.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <!-- NEW: Contact Information Section -->
        <h2>6. Contact Us (Privacy Point of Contact)</h2>
